However, effective detection in multimodal documents is hindered by the semantic heterogeneity across text, figures, and mathematical expressions. We propose the Triplet-aligned Text-Image-Formula Contrastive Similarity Framework (TIF-Contrast).Central to our approach is a triplet-aligned embedding mechanism that projects diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. By constructing contrastive "anchor-positive-negative" modality triplets, the framework forces semantically consistent cross-modal content to cluster closely in the shared space, enabling accurate, end-to-end similarity retrieval for papers, theses, and technical documents.✨ Key ContributionsTriplet-Aligned Embeddings: A novel strategy to constrain feature distribution across text, image, and formula modalities, bridging the gap of semantic heterogeneity.Unified Semantic Space: Facilitates direct cross-modal retrieval without the need for complex, manual late-fusion heuristics.Adaptive Multimodal Fusion: Specifically designed to handle variable modal distributions (e.g., documents with varying densities of formulas or figures).End-to-End Framework: Optimized for large-scale academic document databases to identify sophisticated plagiarism.🏗️ Framework ArchitectureTIF-Contrast utilizes three specialized encoders feeding into a shared contrastive learning objective:Text Encoder: Captures the semantic nuances of academic language.Image Encoder: Extracts visual features from figures, charts, and tables.Formula Encoder: A structural encoder designed for the symbolic semantics of mathematical expressions (LaTeX/MathML).The alignment is governed by a Triplet Margin Loss:$$L(a, p, n) = \max(0, d(f(a), f(p)) - d(f(a), f(n)) + \text{margin})$$where $a, p, n$ represent anchor, positive, and negative modality samples respectively.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+PyTorch 2.0+CUDA 11.8+ (Recommended)InstallationBashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TIF-Contrast.git
cd TIF-Contrast
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage1. Data PreparationPlace your multimodal document data in the data/ directory. Ensure each document entry contains the corresponding text snippets, image paths, and formula strings.2. TrainingBashpython train.py --config configs/base_config.yaml --output_dir ./checkpoints
3. Inference/EvaluationPythonfrom model import TIFContrast
from evaluator import SimilarityEvaluator

model = TIFContrast.load_from_checkpoint("checkpoints/tif_contrast_best.pth")
score = model.calculate_similarity(doc_a, doc_b)
print(f"Similarity Score: {score:.4f}")
📊 Experimental ResultsOur framework was evaluated against several unimodal and multimodal baselines. TIF-Contrast demonstrates superior performance in detecting "obfuscated" plagiarism where modalities are altered but semantic meaning remains identical.Model VariantPrecisionRecallMAPF1-ScoreText-Only Baseline0.8320.8140.8120.823Text-Image (Dual)0.8650.8520.8560.858Text-Formula (Dual)0.8840.8700.8730.877TIF-Contrast (Ours)0.9510.9420.9450.946✍️ CitationIf you find this work or code useful for your research, please cite our paper:Code snippet@article{li2026tifcontrast,
